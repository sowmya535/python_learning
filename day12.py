#FOR LOOP PROBLEMS
#important problems
#1. print numbers from 1 to 10 in one line
for n in range(1, 11):
    print(n, end=' ')
print()                  #1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
#2. print even numbers from 5 to 30 in one line
for n in range(5, 31):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n, end=' ')
print()                     #6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30
#3. print odd numbers from 5 to 30 in one line
#4. print numbers divisible by 5 from 1 to 30 in one line
#5. print numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 from 1 to 100 in one line
#6. sum of numbers from 10 to 25 
sum = 0 
for n in range(10, 26):
    sum += n 
print(f'Sum of numbers from 10 and 25 is {sum}')  sum of numbers from 10 and 25 is 280
#7. sum of numbers in list [4,3,2,5,6,7] 
#8. multiplication table of a number 
#9. factorial 
#9. fibonacci 
a = 0
b = 1 
n = 10 
for i in range(n):
    print(a, end=' ')
    a, b = b, a + b 
print()               #0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

#10. reverse a string
        # 012345
string = 'rakesh'
rev = ''
for i in range(len(string)-1, -1, -1):
    rev = rev + string[i]
print(f'Revers of {string} is {rev}')    Reverse of rakesh is hsekar
#11. count vowels in a string
#12. count z's and y's in a string
#13. check whether a number is prime number or not 





#WHILE LOOP PROBLEMS
#print 1 to 10 with while loop
#print even numbers from 1 to 10
#print numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 from 1 to 500 
#count digits
#reverse a number
#palindrome number 
#palindrome string without slicing, without built in function
#armstrong number
